# Genesis Starter

A Genesis Framework starter theme with Gulp support.  I took StudioPress' original Genesis Sampler theme and added my stuff.

## Requirements

* [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)
* [Genesis Framework](http://my.studiopress.com/themes/genesis/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
* [Node](http://nodejs.org/) (for NPM)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
* [Browserify](http://browserify.org/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [scss-lint](https://github.com/causes/scss-lint)
* [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) (for `gulp-unretina`)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository and change the theme's name.
2. There is no `style.css` in the root, that is built by Gulp. The header comment metadata can be edited at `src/sass/_meta.scss`.
3. Run `composer install` to install PHP dependencies.
4. Run `npm install` to setup the build tools and install JavaScript dependencies.
5. Run `gulp build` to generate public site assets from sources.

## CSS Preprocessor Support

Genesis Starter uses Sass out of the box, but it should not be at all hard to configure a Gulp task to handle different preprocessors (such as LESS or Stylus).

## JavaScript and Browserify

The Starter uses Browserify to better allow modularization of client-side code using modules.

By default, your code is concatenated into a file called `app.js`, while external dependencies (installed using NPM) are concatenated into `infrastructure.js`.

The Browserify build process also handles ECMAScript 2015 transparently, using Babel to convert it into the kind of JavaScript most browsers support today.

## Build Tasks

The Genesis starter provides the following Gulp tasks.

| Task           | Description                                              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `watch`        | Watches files for changes and rebuilds assets (default). |
| `build`        | Runs `browserify`, `sass` and `images`.                  |
| `test`         | Runs `tape` and `phpunit`.                               |
| `clean`        | Deletes the built assets so you can start afresh.        |
| `browser-sync` | Reloads and syncs browsers on multiple devices.          |
| `browserify`   | Packages JavaScript bundles from their sources.          |
| `eslint`       | Lints your JavaScript code.                              |
| `i18n`         | Generates a .POT file.                                   |
| `images`       | Copies and compresses image assets.                      |
| `phpunit`      | Runs PHPUnit test cases.                                 |
| `sass`         | Compiles, minifies and concatenates CSS from Sass.       |
| `tape`         | Runs Tape tests.                                         |

Task parameters may be configured via the _gulp/config.js_ file.

## BrowserSync

The `watch` task uses BrowserSync to observe files, automate browser refreshes and allow synchronised testing between different devices on the same site.

In order to do this, BrowserSync creates a local proxy that channels connections to the development site defined in the `browserSync.proxy` entry of _gulp/config.js_.

The proxy configuration requires that your WordPress site be available from multiple domain or host names, a feature offered by a plugin such as [WP Hydra](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hydra/). (I recommend that you use these plugins for _development only_, since activating them on a public site could severely affect your site's search rankings.)

Feel free to experiment (and report on) different BrowserSync configurations, but from those I've tried this is the one that work best for me.
